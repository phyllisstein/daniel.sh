                        If you’re suggesting I play favorites, you’re wrong. I love all of my children
                        equally. [earlier] I don’t care for Gob. I was set up. By the Brits. A group of
                        British builders operating outside the O.C.

                        I’m gonna build me an airport, put my name on it. Why,
                        Michael? So you can fly away from your feelings? I’m sure,
                        wherever your father is, she loves you very much. That was Tom Cruise, the
                        actor. They said he was some kind of scientist. She’s not
                        that Mexican, Mom. She’s my Mexican. And she’s Columbian or something. There’s
                        unlimited juice? This party is gonna be off the hook. For the same reason you
                        should believe a hundred dollar bill is no more than a
                        hundred pennies!

                    <p>
                        Saw this on the highway and almost blue myself. Hop on? Are you at all concerned
                        about an uprising? Annyong. The only thing I found in the fridge was a dead dove
                        in a bag. There’s a girl in my soup! That was Tom Cruise, the actor. They said
                        he was some kind of scientist.

                        She’s always got to wedge herself in the middle of us so that she can control
                        everything. Yeah. Mom’s awesome. It’s as Ann as the nose on plain’s face.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I know she’s a brownish area! With points! And I love her! One of the guys told
                        me to take my head out of my BOTTOM and get back to work…my BOTTOM! Hahahaha.
                        Here he comes. Here comes John Wayne. I was hoping he would be gifted sexually.
                        Everyone’s laughing, and riding, and cornholing except Buster. It’s so watery.
                        And yet there’s a smack of ham to it.

                    So maybe you could start jete-ing, and stop je-terrorizing me! What’s next,
                    Michael? Are you going to make dancing illegal? Is this the tiny town from
                    Footloose? A trick is something a whore does for money…or candy. Somewhere… over
                    the rainbow… there’s another rainbow… A night of heterosexual intercourse.

                    Te quiero. English, please. I love you! Great, now I’m late. Excuse me, do these
                    effectively hide my thunder? I know, I just call her Annabelle cause she’s
                    shaped like a…she’s the belle of the ball!

                <p>
                    Fried cheese… with club sauce. Popcorn shrimp… with club sauce. Chicken fingers…
                    with spicy club sauce. I was set up. By the Brits. It ain’t easy being white…
