                    If you’re suggesting I play favorites, you’re wrong. I love all of my children
                    equally. [earlier] I don’t care for Gob. I was set up. By the Brits. A group of
                    British builders operating outside the O.C.

                    I’m gonna build me an airport, put my name on it. Why,
                    Michael? So you can fly away from your feelings? I’m sure,
                    wherever your father is, she loves you very much. That was Tom Cruise, the
                    actor. They said he was some kind of scientist. She’s not
                    that Mexican, Mom. She’s my Mexican. And she’s Columbian or something. There’s
                    unlimited juice? This party is gonna be off the hook. For the same reason you
                    should believe a hundred dollar bill is no more than a
                    hundred pennies!
