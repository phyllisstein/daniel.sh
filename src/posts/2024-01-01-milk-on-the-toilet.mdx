title: Five Reasons Drinking Milk on the Toilet Is Kind of a Game Changer
---

I've been in the film business for a while but I just can't seem to get one in the can. She keeps saying that God is going to show me a sign. The… something of my ways.


## Her?
Let's make Ann the backup, okay? Very good way to think about her, as a backup. I got Michael out of his marriage, didn't I? Actually, she died. Go ahead, touch the cornballer.

These are my awards, Mother. From Army. The seal is for marksmanship, and the gorilla is for sand racing.

I am going to my spin class. I thought you had vertigo. Ann certainly has a great deal of Mass. She's a girl, I need to teach her how to be a woman. Within her lies a queen. Let me out that queen. No! These are just strippers! Look how hot they are!


### I'm a monster.
I didn't get into this business to please sophomore Tracy Schwartzman, so… onward and upward. On… Why, Tracy?! Why?!! So did you see the new Poof? His name's Gary and we don't need anymore lawsuits. Operation Hot Mother. She's a contestant. It's sorta like an inner beauty pageant. Ah, there it is.

1.  I'm a monster.
1.  One for the ladies. I know, I just call her Annabelle cause she's shaped like a… she's the belle of the ball!
1.  Michael was concerned that he was caught in a lie about his family. The family was concerned that they were being confronted by a woman they had clubbed, drugged, and left on a bench. Everyone's laughing, and riding, and cornholing except Buster.

    I know, I just call her Annabelle cause she's shaped like a… she's the belle of the ball! The support group? Can you believe that the only reason the club is going under is because it's in a terrifying neighborhood? Operation Hot Mother. I don't criticize you! And if you're worried about criticism, sometimes a diet is the best defense.


## More lies.
There's been a lot of lying in this family. And a lot of love!

- Did Ted make an appointment? No. Well, then Ted can GET THE HELL OUT OF THIS OFFICE! YOU GET THE HELL OUT! I hear the jury's still out on science. There's been a lot of lying in this family. And a lot of love! More lies. She wanted to look 48. I nearly airbrushed her into oblivion. Ended up checking "albino" on the form.
- Say goodbye to THESE!
- Buster's in what we like to call a light to no coma. In laymans terms, it might be considered a very heavy nap. Let me take off my assistant's skirt and put on my Barbra-Streisand-in-_The-Prince-of-Tides_ ass-masking therapist pantsuit.


## So Dramatic and Flamboyant
Don't leave your Uncle T-bag hanging. Michael was concerned that he was caught in a lie about his family. The family was concerned that they were being confronted by a woman they had clubbed, drugged, and left on a bench. Heart attack never stopped old Big Bear. I didn't even know we were calling him Big Bear. We never had the chance to.

But I didn't take wasn't optimistic it could be done for an answer. What's up, fizz-ellas.

I should be in this Poof. I'm a scholar. I enjoy scholarly pursuits. Suddenly playing with yourself is a scholarly pursuit? Hey, it was one night of wild passion! And yet you didn't notice her body? I like to look in the mirror. It walked on my pillow! You go buy a tape recorder and record yourself for a whole day. I think you'll be surprised at some of your phrasing. I mean, **COME ON**. Suddenly he's too much of a big-shot to brush mother's hair.
